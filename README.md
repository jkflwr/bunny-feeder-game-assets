# bunny-feeder-game-assets
when i started this game, I had it as a space shooters but then decided to change it to bunnies and
carrots. So, I didnt change any of the variables or image names so they are still
named after the space game (spaceship = carrot bag, aliens = bunnies, bullets = carrots)
(also I made this with pygame to you have to add that)

controls: 
    left arrow key -> moves left
    right arrow key -> moves right
    space bar -> shoots bullets
